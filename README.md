# Ergo Playgrounds
Run contracts + off-chain code in the browser. 
1. Design and model a contract along with its off-chain counterpart in the same Scala environment. 
2. Share and discuss the contract. Explain how it works.
3. Check different scenarios of contract execution.

Enjoy:
- seamless on-chain < - > off-chain code integration;
- immediate feedback.
